Our Project:
Create a canvas type website page that includes our work from the first half of the tri
Make sure we meet all ap requirements and show our learnings in our journal
Our goal for this project is to make it like an online arcade where you can pick different games to choose from
Make the website unique so it is not just a blank page with links
Add animations, cool backgrounds, etc.

We are using python 3.8 for our project

Week 9 11/2:
What we did this week:

11/5: We went to breakout rooms right away to work on our project and prepare for our video due tomorrow

Mr. M talked about our final project and the live running link we will need to have by the 18th. Then we went to breakouts to work on our code

11/3: 
We were lectured on embedding different things such as menus or google docs into our website

11/2:
Mr. M introduced our video assignment due Friday. We have to create a one minute video showing the front end, back end, python, and tools used in our project


Individual Assignments:

Noah: Get a running web server working in IntelliJ, learn how to embid repl.it links and google docs

================

Week 8: 10/26
What we did this week:


10/29:
Today, Mr. Mortensen gave us a digital citizenship check. Noah had Github, while Nolan and Troy didnâ€™t. We have to work on connecting our project through IntelliJ and Github by creating a repository.

10/28:
Today, Mr. M gave a lecture on jinja. This was very needed for our group since we struggled incorporating that last week to our project. After the lecture, we focused on our readme, since we were missing that as well. We still need to learn how to incorporate github

10/27:
Today, Nolan and Troy were absent. I just wrote a reflection of our last week in slack and what lectures our group can benefit on. We realized what we were missing in our project

10/26:
No school

Individual Assignments:

Noah: Transfer work from repl.it to github and intelliJ. Update readme.md file on daily basis. Work on website code/visuals. Update journal.

Nolan: Create trig functions on calculator. Create new math function to allow math to parse as it is shown in the calculator display form. Research built-in javascript functions to help with this process.

Troy: Help work on the calculator. Add notes in the readme, and understand github and intelliJ.


=================

Week 6 10/12:
What we did this week:

Monday 10/12:
Mr. M introduced our new project for the second half of the tri: a website using flask
We started to understand our goals for this trimester and the things we will have to learn to build our project

Tuesday 10/13:
We went into breakouts and started our repl.it for our website
We had to import flask in our project

Wednesday: 10/14:
Dane taught the class how to install github and IntelliJ on our desktop

Thursday 10/15:
Mr. M briefly discussed our portfolio idea and type of project, and what we should be able to produce 
We went into breakouts to work on our new repl.it, journal, and project document

Friday 10/16:
We were put into breakout rooms to finish up our work for this week
We then presented what we have to another group, and we talked about what we need to do in the next six weeks

Goals for this week:
See our new project for the second half of the trimester
Understand and import flask in our new repl.it
Use flask resources in the timeline to help us and start creating our website
Update the new sections of our journal and project plan
Individual Tasks/Summary:
Troy: This week there wasn't really much to do, I downloaded all the software needed for the project and I also wrote the main framework down for the code to the website.
Noah: This week, I updated the journal and created our new project document. I also put the beginning lines of code in our repl.it, so that we can get our website started. I looked at all of the videos and documents Mr. M put out on the timeline under flask resources so that I can understand what we need to do. 
Nolan: I watched the flask youtube tutorial videos and read the student made google docs to help familiarize myself with flask. I used classes and objects to organize the data of our past and present projects on the flask website we made. I learned some html structure code like title, heading, paragraph, as well as how to make a class for indentation, font size, etc. in html. I added an image to our home page to make it have more WOW factor.

Self Grading for Journal:
Troy: 43/45
Noah: 45/45
Nolan: 45/45
